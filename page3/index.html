<p>Come join us for our first meeting of the 2014 fall semester! <strong><span style="color: #3f77c0;">The general meeting is on Monday, September 8th, from 6:30 -8:00 pm in CPE Room #2.208 on the UT campus. </span></strong>For those of us less familiar with the area, CPE is the Chemical &amp; Petroleum Engineering Building. (See link for directions: <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/cpe.html">http://www.utex​as.edu/maps/mai​n/buildings/cpe​.html</a>)</p>
<p>Dr. Jay Banner with the UT Jackson School of Geosciences will be presenting on "Past, Present, and Future Climate Change in Texas; Science, Impacts and Policy". Dr. Banner is a professor in the Department of Geological Sciences and also serves as the Director of the Environmental Science Institute. <strong><span style="color: #3f77c0;">For our professional members, this presentation will qualify as one PDH towards your annual Continuing Education.</span>  </strong>Light refreshments will be provided.</p>
<p>We will also be talking about our two newest projects in the Greater Austin Chapter: the Chacayá, Guatemala water project and our Instrumentation program. All of our projects are collaborative efforts supported by both students and professionals with varying levels of knowledge and expertise. <strong><span style="color: #3f77c0;">You do not have to be an engineer to join! </span></strong>The general meeting is an excellent opportunity to learn more about ways to get involved and meet our Board members for the upcoming year. There are a lot of exciting things happening in the Chapter and we look forward to seeing you at the meeting!!</p>

<p>EWB – Greater Austin friends and family celebrated the summer at our annual Day at the Park event on Sunday, July 20th in Zilker Park. It was one of those great Texas summer afternoons where the sunshine melts onto your skin and you get to kick back &amp; relax. We had a great turnout, with lots of people bringing snacks and beverages of their choice. EWB-GA provided the fajitas, tortillas, and typical Tex-Mex sides. Props to our very own Grill Master, Paul H. for the expertly grilled fajita meat!</p>
<p>For the most part, the heat kept everyone tranquil, but a few of the more adventurous EWBers played Frisbee and ran around with our furry four-legged friends. It was awesome getting to know a few of the EWB folks better, outside of meetings, and to meet everyone's friends &amp; pets. If you weren’t able to join us this time, don't worry- there are other events upcoming! Be sure to check the calendar for them. :)</p>

<p>On July 8th, EWB-Greater Austin members presented a case study in climate change to students from Mexico as part of UT Austin's new Summer Engineering Development (SED) program.</p>
<p>The case study discussed the concept of climate change and its far-reaching global consequences, while also introducing students to EWB-GA's current irrigation project in Huasta, Peru. After some initial background on the people, lifestyles and geography typical to Huasta, students were asked to examine and prioritize a variety of current issues faced by Peruvians which are related to climate change. During the discussion, EWB members provided unique insights based on their personal experience with the international development process. Particular emphasis was placed on cultural awareness, an understanding of the community's commitment to a project and the technical feasibility of each potential solution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, each team of students analyzed and presented their solution to one of the discussed issues. EWB members administering the case study also related the teams' proposals to actual decisions made by the EWB-GA Peru team on the project. The conversation between students and EWBers was incredibly creative, enthusiastic and informative. All in all, there was a lot of learning, laughs and pizza!</p>
<p>Specials thanks to Genevieve Countryman (Support Services Advisor for UT Austin International Student &amp; Scholar Services) for facilitating the event!</p>

<p>Tuesday June 10th we were accompanied by Enrique Dominguez, Director of the EOE Program at The University of Texas at Austin, and led a panel of engineering students and professionals to help answer some of the questions from students in the UT SED Program about what it's like to be an engineer in America.</p>
