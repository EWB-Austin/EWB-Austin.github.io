<p>The signing of the memorandum of understanding came after visits to two potential project sites within the Tres Cuencas Commonwealth, Canrey Chico and Huasta. EWB-AUS volunteers were accompanied on these visits by employees of The Mountain Institute who are familiar with the communities and their water needs. The assessment team spoke with representatives of the communities, collected GPS data, and investigated current water infrastructure. The team looks forward to sharing its findings with the rest of EWB-AUS and selecting the first project for the Peru Program.</p>
