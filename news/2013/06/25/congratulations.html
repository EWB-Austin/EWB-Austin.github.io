<p>Congratulations to both our project teams for receiving technical approval to travel!  The Peru Project is sending six travellers to implement a spring-fed water distribution and irrigation system during the month of July and the Panama Project is sending six travellers to build household bio-sand filters during the month of August!  We wish them safe travels and can't wait to hear about the results of their trips!</p>
