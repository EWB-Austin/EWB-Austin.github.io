<div>UT has an American Red Cross Club and they are offering CPR training and First Aid Training all day this Saturday February 20, and at a very reasonable price.  In addition to being a good skill to have in general, this is a great opportunity to take advantage of because EWB National  is requiring that several members on every team that travels be CPR certified and they  encourage that most members have this certification.  If you are thinking about traveling for Panama please consider this. Here is the link to the schedule (<a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.utmasscpr.org/course_info" target="_blank">http://www.utmasscpr.org/course_info</a>).</div>
