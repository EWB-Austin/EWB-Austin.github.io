<p>Please note the March Chapter meeting has been canceled.  The Chapter will be holding quarterly general meetings rather than monthly to allow the valuable time resources to be directed toward our current project and chapter needs.  A newsletter will be issued soon with an update on chapter activities and schedules.  Our sincere apologies for the short notice and any inconvenience caused.</p>
