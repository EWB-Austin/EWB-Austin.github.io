<p>EWB will be participating in Soup and Bread Night, Wednesday, February 26, hosted by the Northwestern University Austin Alumni Club, at <a title="The Liberty" href="http://www.thelibertyaustin.com/" target="_blank">The Liberty</a>, at 1618 1/2 E 6th.  Along with several other nonprofits, we'll be serving soup (<em>Sopa Criolla</em>), and bread will be provided by Easy Tiger.  There's a $10 cover to try all the soups, and all of the proceeds go to the participants.  So come out and support EWB Greater Austin, and a bunch of other worthy causes.  See you there!</p>
