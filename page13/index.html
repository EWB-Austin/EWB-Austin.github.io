  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congratulations to our Panama Clean Water and Health project for having two photos selected as winners in the  EWB-USA  International Conference Photo Contest!!</p>
<p>[gallery columns="2"]</p>
<p>One photo was selected in the  "Projects" category (the picture of the kids backfilling the trench) and a second was selected in the "People" category (the picture of the boys washing their  hands).  A total of 10 photos in each category were selected so this is quite an honor.  Out of all of EWB's projects EWB-AUS Panama was selected for not one but two categories!</p>
<p>All winning photographs will:</p>
<ul>
<li> Be printed and displayed at the EWB-USA 2011 International Conference</li>
<li>Be displayed at the EWB-USA Headquarters in Boulder, CO for the 2011 year</li>
<li>Be used in EWB-USA marketing and PR materials</li>
<li>Be given first preference for photograph requests by our Corporate Partners and the media</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to the Panama project team!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear EWB-USA Student Chapter Presidents,</p>
<p>Please  pass the announcement below on to your members as soon as possible.   This is an opportunity to participate in a study on the effects of  service-based educational experience over time.</p>
<p>To: EWB-USA engineering students</p>
<p>Background:  "Engineering Pathways" is a research project funded by the U.S.  National Science Foundation that aims to follow the professional  trajectories of about 500 engineering students over the next three  years. In brief, our research will involve measuring changes over time  in students’ beliefs, knowledge, skills and attitudes towards  engineering and their own engineering education.  Our effort will  include students who are involved in service-based efforts (like EWB)  and those who are not. Our hope is that by following students over time,  the effects of service-based educational experiences, both positive and  negative, can be identified. This insight will in turn influence the  design of engineering education in the future.</p>
<p>If you are  selected, you will be asked to do a few short online surveys a couple  times each year, and some participants will be interviewed. All  participants  will be compensated for their time each year.</p>
<p>Restrictions: you  must be (1) an engineering student, (2) currently involved in an  Engineers Without Borders chapter at your university, (3) either a  first-year OR junior-year student now (sorry, no sophomores, seniors, or  grad students), (4) at least 18-years old by February 1, 2011, and (5)  NOT a student at Michigan Tech, Tufts, Colorado-Boulder, or James  Madison (we already have those universities as focus schools)</p>
<p>Time of involvement: a couple hours per year for three years</p>
<p>To express your interest in being a participant, go to: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/EngineeringPathways2" target="_blank">http://www.surveymonkey.com/EngineeringPathways2</a><br />
Time to complete: 5 minutes</p>
<p>Due: Monday 17 January 2011, 7:59 am Eastern</p>
<p>The study will begin in early February, 2011. If you have any questions, please contact the study's lead  researchers:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>I am Vice-President of the Construction Engineering and Project  Management Graduate Student Organization. We are currently hosting Gen.  Bud Ahearn (ret.) one of the founding sponsors and board member of EWB  for a lecture on "Civil Engineering Profession-Leadership in Motion".  The lecture will be <strong>November 11th at 1:30 PM in the Avaya Auditorium</strong> (ACE 2.302).</div>
<div></div>
<div>We thought that it would be of great interest to  your organization's member's to have the opportunity to attend. We will  be putting up posters around the engineering building next week.</div>
