  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today in the City of Chiquián during the meeting of the Tres Cuencas Commonwealth Board of Directors, Peru Program Lead Laura Read, along with President Ernesto Rivera of the Commonwealth and Cristina Giraud of The Mountain Institute, signed a Memorandum of Understanding signifying official cooperation of the three organizations. This <a title="Foundational Documents" href="http://ewbgreateraustin.org/projects/peru/foundational-documents/">foundational document</a> states how the three organizations will work together to facilitate community projects that mitigate the impacts of climate change in rural Peru.</p>

<p>The signing of the memorandum of understanding came after visits to two potential project sites within the Tres Cuencas Commonwealth, Canrey Chico and Huasta. EWB-AUS volunteers were accompanied on these visits by employees of The Mountain Institute who are familiar with the communities and their water needs. The assessment team spoke with representatives of the communities, collected GPS data, and investigated current water infrastructure. The team looks forward to sharing its findings with the rest of EWB-AUS and selecting the first project for the Peru Program.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>BOULDER, CO – The Engineers Without Borders USA Greater Austin Professional Chapter has been named a 2011 EWB-USA Outstanding Project for their water supply project in Sieykin, Panama.</p>
<p>The honor recognizes excellence in EWB-USA projects and highlights projects that deliver high quality, sustainable solutions to help meet the basic needs of partnering communities abroad.</p>
<p>“The EWB-USA Greater Austin Professional’s water supply project is a model project for diversity within a chapter and the benefits it provides to the project team and community,” said Cathy Leslie, Executive Director of EWB-USA. “The project team consists of a mix of professionals, graduate, and undergraduate students who each brings valuable perspectives and contributions to the project. The team’s strength has also been demonstrated by their resilience and long-term commitment to the community despite the various challenges that have come up along the way; it is no question why they have been given this recognition.”</p>
<p>The 400 residents of the community drink untreated surface water from streams and rivers in the surrounding area. Sanitation within the community is limited to shallow pit latrines that are subject to flooding during the heavy rains. These unsanitary conditions, coupled with consumption of non-potable water, cause community members to suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal health issues. The Greater Austin Professional Chapter of EWB-USA, which has approximately 50 members, began working in Panama in 2009. Over the coming years, the chapter will continue working in Sieykin until all five sectors of the community have a reliable drinking water system. Future projects in Sieykin may include improving sanitation infrastructure.<br />
EWB-USA, which grew out of a project by the University of Colorado-Boulder in Belize in 2000, has more than 250 chapters, including 180 chapters on colleges and university campuses in the United States, and more than 12,000 members. EWB-USA has more than 350 projects in more than 45 developing countries around the world, including water, renewable energy and sanitation. The projects are completed in partnership with local communities and non-governmental organizations.</p>
<p>EWB-USA is a national non-profit humanitarian organization established to partner with developing communities worldwide in order to improve their quality of life. The partnership involves implementing environmentally and economically sustainable engineering projects, while involving and training internationally responsible engineering professionals.</p>
