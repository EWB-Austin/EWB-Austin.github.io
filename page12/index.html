  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dear EWB-USA Student Chapter Presidents,</p>
<p>Please  pass the announcement below on to your members as soon as possible.   This is an opportunity to participate in a study on the effects of  service-based educational experience over time.</p>
<p>To: EWB-USA engineering students</p>
<p>Background:  "Engineering Pathways" is a research project funded by the U.S.  National Science Foundation that aims to follow the professional  trajectories of about 500 engineering students over the next three  years. In brief, our research will involve measuring changes over time  in students’ beliefs, knowledge, skills and attitudes towards  engineering and their own engineering education.  Our effort will  include students who are involved in service-based efforts (like EWB)  and those who are not. Our hope is that by following students over time,  the effects of service-based educational experiences, both positive and  negative, can be identified. This insight will in turn influence the  design of engineering education in the future.</p>
<p>If you are  selected, you will be asked to do a few short online surveys a couple  times each year, and some participants will be interviewed. All  participants  will be compensated for their time each year.</p>
<p>Restrictions: you  must be (1) an engineering student, (2) currently involved in an  Engineers Without Borders chapter at your university, (3) either a  first-year OR junior-year student now (sorry, no sophomores, seniors, or  grad students), (4) at least 18-years old by February 1, 2011, and (5)  NOT a student at Michigan Tech, Tufts, Colorado-Boulder, or James  Madison (we already have those universities as focus schools)</p>
<p>Time of involvement: a couple hours per year for three years</p>
<p>To express your interest in being a participant, go to: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/EngineeringPathways2" target="_blank">http://www.surveymonkey.com/EngineeringPathways2</a><br />
Time to complete: 5 minutes</p>
<p>Due: Monday 17 January 2011, 7:59 am Eastern</p>
<p>The study will begin in early February, 2011. If you have any questions, please contact the study's lead  researchers:</p>
